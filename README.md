# RockPaperScissors_v0.2

This is a web-socket application that hosts a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It is able to handle multiple players and uses a virtual server to determine the outcome of each game. Loading the application in a separate window/tab acts as another player. Version 0.2 introduced two additional "weapons" to choose from: Lizard and Spock. There are still some bugs to work out with the sessions.
